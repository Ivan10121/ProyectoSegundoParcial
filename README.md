This program is a simulation of a calendar in which we can save events that will have a name and date and optionally the user can add a place and a description of the event, it also has pre-established festive dates.

When starting the program, the first thing that is shown are the options of: 
1.	Create an event
2.	Modify event 
3.	Delete event 
4.	Search event 
5.	Days remaining 
6.	Generate a txt with a summary of the events of the month
7.  Exit

In the first option, the program asks if we want to add an event with a place and description, after deciding if our event will have a description or not, it will ask us if we want the event to be repeated, if we choose the repeat option, it will ask us every when the event will be repeated, and then it will request the information of the event (name, day, year and place, description, if we choose this option).


In the second option, it will ask us for the name of the event that we want to edit, then it will ask us what we want to delete (name, date, month, year, place, description) and then it will ask us for the new values.


In the third option it will ask us for the name of the event that we want o delete, if the event does not exist it will throw us a message saying that the event does not exist.


In the fourth option, it will ask us for the name of the event we want to search for, if it exists it will print the event information, otherwise the program will send us a message saying that it does not exist. 


The fifth option is to calculate the days remaining for an event, there is also an option to make the account with a new date. First it will ask us if we want to make the account with an event already created, in this case it will ask us for the name of the event and it will tell us the days that are missing for it, if we wan to make the account with a new date, we will have to enter the date.


In the sixth option, a file named summary of the month.txt is generated in which all the added events that are of the month will be included.
